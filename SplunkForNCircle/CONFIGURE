Splunk For nCircle - CONFIGURE
-------------------------------------------------------------
09/08/2015


1. Referenced Architecture

(a) Splunk Searchhead -- over tcp/8089 --> (b) Splunk indexer <-- over tcp/8089 -- (c) Splunk HeavyForwarder -- over tcp/22 --> (d) IP360 nCircle APIv2

1.1. App Deployment
(a) - enable app itself
(b) - enable index for vulnerability data from nCircle
(c) - enable inputs in the App


2. Configuration

2.1. nCircle Setup
- configure user on nCircle IP360 appliance to get proper access rights to run APIv2 commands. 
- connection is initiated by Splunk towards nCircle IP360 over tcp/22. Credentials are configured in the ncircle.conf file

2.2. Data adjustment
- data is being fetched according to unique identificators in the IP360 system.

2.2.1. getAuditLog.py
- get the latest counter for auditlog data from class.AuditLog via APIv2 
	server.call(session, 'class.AuditLog', 'search', {'query':'id>0'})
- choose reasonable ID and adjust variable called latest_counter in the script
- Next ID will be stored in the counter_file. Adjust path of counter_file. By default it is located in $APP_HOME$/bin folder.

2.2.2. getAuditDetails.py
- get the relevant identificators of device profilers for fetching the audits from
	server.call(session, 'class.DP', 'search', {'query':'id>0'})
	server.call(session, 'DP.1', 'getAttributes', {})
- store identificators of device profilers in variable called deviceProfilers
- get the latest counter for audit data from class.Audit via APIv2
	server.call(session, 'class.Audit', 'search', {'query':'id>0'})
- choose reasonable ID and adjust variable called blg in the script
- adjust path of audit_file. By default it is located in $APP_HOME$/bin folder.


3. App Deployment

3.1. Searchhead
- copy the app into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- verify macros.conf file and ensure the proper splunk_server, index, sourcetype (see 3.3.) is used

3.2. Indexer
- copy the app into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- adjust and enable indexes.conf file

3.3. Heavy Forwarder
- copy the app into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
- adjust and enable inputs.conf file
- be aware that fields in sourcetype=_json is being automatically extracted by Splunk. If changed, all fields should be extracted. The sourcetype should be adjusted in the 3.1. step


4. Troubleshooting
- run the scripts manually:
	/opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python /opt/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkForNCircle/bin/getAuditLog.py
	/opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python /opt/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkForNCircle/bin/getAuditDetails.py
- if it does not help, run python with debuger:
	/opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python -m pdb /opt/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkForNCircle/bin/getAuditLog.py
	/opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python -m pdb /opt/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkForNCircle/bin/getAuditDetails.py
